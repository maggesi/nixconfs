This directory contains a Nix based script to build checkpointed
binaries of HOL Light with various preloaded libraries.

Note that it is enough to have Nix (and Nixpkgs) to install HOL Light
itself.  Simply use
  nix-env -i hol_light
it should work on most systems (on all variants of Linux and MacOSX at
least).  Hence these instructions are useful only if you want to build
checkpointed binaries.

It has been tested only on NixOS (http://nixos.org).  It should work
with minimal adaptation on any Linux based distribution with BLCR
checkpoint software and the nix/nkxpkgs suite installed.

Instructions (for NixOS):

1. Install BLCR: set variable environment.blcr.enable = true in
/etc/nixos/configuration.nix.  Then rebuild the system and reboot.

2. Download then HOL Light sources:
  svn checkout http://hol-light.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ hol_light
  cd hol_light

3. Copy or link default.nix and build_hol_light_contexts then run
  ./build_hol_light_contexts

4. At the and of the build, a number of shell scripts to start
hol_light have been created in ~/bin
E.g.:  use
  hol_light_core
to start the basic system or
  hol_light_multivariate
to start HOL Light with multivariate real analysis preloaded.
(Depending on your system it can take some hours to finish the build.
You can easly edit and adapt the script to build only the checkpoints you
need).

Every system upgrade may break the checkpointed binaries.  In this
case it should be enough to run ./build_hol_light_contexts to generate
the new contexts and fix the problem.
